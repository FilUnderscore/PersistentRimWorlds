# Persistent RimWorlds
Turns a RimWorld into a Persistent RimWorld; explore fallen colonies where pirates may lurk and stop by your predecessors.

This RimWorld mod allows you to convert any chosen 'game' (save file) into a persistent rimworld, allowing you to have multiple colonies on the same world. The Persistent RimWorlds mod can be accessed through the main menu.

## Features*
- Start a new colony using a world from a previous save.
- Trade with previous colonies throughout the world. (This may include trading using the actual inventories of said colonies)
- Visit old maps from previous abandoned colonies. (This is a dice roll event, either - structures will be degraded over time OR pirates will have settled in to your surprise when you try to resettle)
- Become enemies/allies with other colonies.
- Convert an existing save game into a persistent world.
- Switch between colonies in-game without having to reload the whole world again, through the Colonies tab.
- Revert to a normal single-colony save game with any colony should you decide to quit playing a persistent world

\* This list may change over time as the mod progresses in development.

## Branches

	<summary>Development, Testing & Compatibility</summary>

	I aim to have this mod compatible with many other mods out there, so this mod 
	runs primarily using Harmony to patch. It however checks first if a persistent 
	world is present - in order to not interfere with single colony games.
	
	This mod will require extensive testing, and so any help is appreciated in 
	stabilizing mod support as well as end-game support. This is because there 
	is still a lot of testing that needs to be conducted and bugs to be fixed, 
	as well as features to be implemented. Any contributions are welcome that 
	improve mod compatibility, bugs or improvements on current mod features. Any 
	suggestions can be reported in the Issues tab with using the 'enhancement' 
	label. Any bugs that need to be reported can be labeled with the 'bug' label.
