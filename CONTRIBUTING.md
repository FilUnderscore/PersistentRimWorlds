# Contributing

## Setup
This mod relies mainly on the RimWorld `Assembly-CSharp` dll file which can be found in the `Rimworld_Win(64)_Data/Managed` folder (dependent on 32-bit or 64-bit systems) and add the file as a reference. 

Grab the latest Harmony 2.X and Color Picker from the links in `Contributions` in the `README.md` file and add those as references too.

## How you can contribute
### Filing bug reports
You can file bug reports under the `Issues` tab in the hotbar near the top of the page using the Issue templates provided for further information regarding how the bug occurs, what it affects/its behaviours.

### Contributing to features
You can also contribute to features by making a copy of this repository and setting it up as provided above. Ideally try to implement any features planned for the next few versions in the `Projects`/`Issues` tabs, but suggestions and other features are welcome too (anything that will improve the mod).

#### Remember, keep your commit messages relevant to any issues you are referencing for fixing/implementing things and open `Issues` with the 'enhancement' tag to open discussion about certain features to be implemented.
